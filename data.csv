  providing, as a paid service, short-stay accommodation services. Since 2010,
  nautical ports have no longer been considered reporting units or types of
  accommodation facilities in the monthly survey on tourist arrivals and

  implementation of the new legal basis of monitoring the tourists, data from
  2005 to 2009 were revised so they can be comparable with data from 2010
  (nautical ports were excluded). Since 2017, data on tourist traffic (number
  of tourist arrivals and nights) and accommodation capacities have been taken
  over from the administrative source of the eVisitor system. Source: CBS,

  because of the implementation of the new legal basis of monitoring the
  tourists. Due to the mentioned change in the methodology, data from 2005 to
  2009 were revised so they can be comparable to 2010 (nautical ports were
  excluded).
    2/ Includes road passengers in transit.
    3/ Data from survey on traffic in airports, all international
  arrivals.
    4/ Data from survey on traffic in sea ports, all international arrivals.
  Includes passengers on cruise ships.

  Includes passengers on cruise ships. Data includes total arrivals of
  non-resident passengers at national borders by road. Passengers in transit

  coronavirus epidemic in 2020, emergency measures were introduced, border
  traffic was significantly lower than usual. In the second quarter of 2020,
  data collection was suspended, so the production of these data was done by
  model estimation and imputation. Due to the low number of data providers, the
  reliability of the published data has decreased and they are only to a
  limited extent comparable with the data of previous periods.
    2/ The observation of the borders with the countries of the Schengen Area
  ceased from the year 2008. Departures of non-resident visitors.

  UNWTO, which do not appear in the International Monetary Fund data. Due to
  lack of data on international tourism receipts concerning statistics on
  inbound tourism, the Department of ""Internet and Statistics Service of
  the Ministry of Tourism"" considers that a tourist spends an average of
  US$ 1,000."

,Arrivals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1/ Arrivals of
  non-resident tourists by air.
    2/ Prior to 2015, the Directorate for Information and Monitoring of
  Immigration and Emigration (DRCIE) of the Ministry of Public Security of
  Madagascar recorded the nationalities of visitors for the entire country. For
  the year 2018, a clear improvement was put in place compared to the
  collection system for the landing at Nosy-Be Airport. Previously, the DRCIE
  was only able to issue data from Ivato International Airport.
    Therefore, figures for ""other countries of the world"" currently
  show the nationalities of non-resident visitors arriving at the six (6)
  international airports of Toamasina, Sainte-Marie, Antsiranana, Mahajanga,
  Fort-Dauphin and Tuléar. End of 2018 and all 2019, NosyBe International
  Airport has 16 flights per week operated by several international companies,
  which shows a clear increase in the number of tourists from various
  nationalities, including Italians.
    3/ Cruise passengers only."

,Arrivals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1/ Beginning
  with 2014 data, automation changes in the methodology for tracking inbound
  visitors enabled the precise counting of one-night stays. This change likely
  added several percentage points to the 2014 performance, and therefore data
  from 2014 onwards is not comparable to previous years. 2015 changes (except
  Canada and Mexico) reflect a combination of additional records counted and
  market conditions.
    2/ Includes Mexico and Canada same-day trips only. Years prior to 2006
  includes Canada day trips only.
    3/ Overseas only; excluding Mexico and Canada (not available).
  Questionnaire wording changed beginning in 2012.
